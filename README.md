# Intro to DevOps - Project Starter Code

# Goal
## Containerize two Flask web services and use Docker Compose to orchestrate them
### For our project, we will be containerizing two Flask apps, one generates a Random Quote, and the other service consumes this and displays it on a neat front end.
### Then we shall be using Docker Swarm to orchestrate the services to achieve our end goal. This exercise will help us understand a real-world use case of Docker and Docker Swarm better.
